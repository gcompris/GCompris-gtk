"- You can save multiple configurations, and switch between them easily. In the 'Profile' section add a profile, then in the 'Board' section select the profile in the combobox, then select the boards you want to be active. You can add multiple profiles, with different lists of boards, and different languages. You set the default profile in the 'Profile' section, by choosing the profile you want, then clicking on the 'Default' button. You can also choose a profile from the command line.\n"
"- You can add users, classes and for each class, you can create groups of users. Note that you can import users from a comma-separated file. Assign one or more groups to a profile, after which those new logins will appear after restarting GCompris. Being able to identify individual children in GCompris means we can provide individual reports. It also recognizes the children as individuals; they can learn to type in and recognize their own usernames (login is configurable)."

msgid "At the beginning of the game four seeds are placed in each house. Players take turns moving the seeds. In each turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under his or her control. The player removes all seeds from this house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from the original house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. That is, the starting house is left empty; if it contained 12 seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. After a turn, if the last seed was placed into an opponent's house and brought its total to two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). If the previous-to-last seed also brought the total seeds in an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on. However, if a move would capture all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game. The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in his/her own territory, ending the game. (Source Wikipedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware&gt;)"

If one number is a factor of a second number, then the second number is a multiple of the first number. Again, you can think of multiples as families, and factors are the people who belong to those families. The factor 5, has parents 10, grandparents 15, great-grandparents 20, great-great-grandparents 25, and every extra step of 5 is another great- in front! But the number 5 does not belong in the 8 or 23 families. You can't fit any number of 5s into 8 or 23 with nothing left over. So '8 isn't a multiple of 5, nor is 23. Only 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ... are multiples (or families or steps) of 5. Use the arrow keys to navigate around the board and to avoid the Troggles. Press the spacebar to eat a number."
