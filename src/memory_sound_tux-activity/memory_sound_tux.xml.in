	<_prerequisite>Mouse manipulation, Brain.</_prerequisite>
	<_goal>Train your audio memory and remove all the violinists Tux.</_goal>
	<_manual>A set of violinist Tux is shown. Each Tux has an associated sound, and each sound has a twin exactly the same. Click on a Tux to see its hidden sound, and try to match the twins. You can only activate two Tux at once, so you need to remember where a sound is, while you listen to its twin. When you turn over the twins, they both disappear.</_manual>
